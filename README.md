# Pattern-Recognition
### Q1 Eigenfaces [10] 
a. Partition the provided face data into your training and testing data, in a way you choose.
Explain briefly the way you partitioned. Apply PCA to your training data, by computing the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix S=(1/N)AAT directly. Show and
discuss the results, including: the eigenvectors, the eigenvalues, and the mean image,
how many eigenvectors with non-zero eigenvalues are obtained and how many
eigenvectors are to be used for face recognition. Give insights and reasons behind your
answers.
b. Apply PCA to your training data, using the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of (1/N)ATA.
Show and discuss the results in comparison to the above, including: if the eigenvectors
and eigenvalues obtained are identical, what are the pros/cons of each method. Show
respective measurements for your answers.
